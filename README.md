# Frontend-Developer-test


Tasks
-----

1. Create a simple Art institute page where users can see, search and view details of the ARTs
- Upon entering the page there are arts of different categories displayed.
- After entering a search term into the text input and clicking on the search button the app should query the Art API and display related Arts
- onclick of any of the Arts, it should go to another page showing the details of the Art
- The [url] is an example of how to access the API and an API key you can use.

2. Write unit tests for the search field and the results list

3. Add mechanics to make all results of the Art search available to the user


Expectations
------------
- A pixel perfect UI(check the link to figma below)

- You are free to choose whatever approach you like, but there should be obvious reasons.
- Mobile and Larger screen responsiveness.
